        <p>
            One of the most significant holy places in Hinduism, the Jagannath temple, is a prime site for Vaishnavas.
            The temple has been into existence since the time of Mahabharata under the reign of King Indradyumna. In the
            12th Century, it was further developed by King Anantavarman, who belonged to the Ganga Dynasty.</p><br>
        <p>
            The deities worshipped inside the temple are a trinity in which Jagannath, Balarama, and Subhadra are the
            names with which they are recognized. The temple hosts a chariot festival annually, which is world-renowned,
            and it is known as Rath Yatra Festival. The three deities are then mounted on the intricately decorated
            Raths and toured across for darshan.</p><br>
